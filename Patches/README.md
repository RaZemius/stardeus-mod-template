# Stardeus JSON patches

JSON patching is easiest and most powerful way to modify the core game definitions and configuration values.
Any JSON file in the Core folder can be modified without replacing it using the patching system.

Patches can be organized into folders for convenience, the system will find them anywhere inside Patches folder.

Stardeus JSON patching is based on a subset of RFC 6902 (JsonPatch) with some limitations and enhancements.

See the JSON examples in this folder to understand the capabilities of JSON patching system.

For debugging mods, look at the contents of "Patched" folder next to user mods / saves dir.
